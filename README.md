# hello-world
This is my first repository on github.

Hi, Im Kanah!

I'm new to coding and this my second attempt to use github.
I am teaching my self code while preparing myself for college.
People say you dont need a degree to be a successful coder and I
agree. So as I learn I'll see where this journey takes me. I will be
following some paths and guides on here to learn all the languages I
possibly can. If I sound like noob forgive me.

okkaaay byeee have a beautifa tieeee!!!! (inside joke with a friend)
